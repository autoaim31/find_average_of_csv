# Finds Average of All Columns in CSV and Converts to Text

Both the python file and executable in this repository do the same thing. When run, both will (1) ask the user for a CSV file on their computer (local storage), (2) finds the average of ALL columns in a CSV (assuming the first row is a column header), and (3) converts the averages (and headers) for every column into a single text. Give it a try!
